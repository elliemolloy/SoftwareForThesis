# SoftwareForThesis
This repository contains a copy of the software used to carry out parts of the work described in my thesis, Metrology of Scattering Distributions.

The Wavelength Calibration program is used with a High Finesse laser spectrum analyser to carry out the wavelength calibration of the Bentham and SpectraPro monochromators.

The Detector Model program was used in 'Diffuse Detector Mode' to calculate the correction factor for the non-uniformity in the response of the detector. It was also used in 'View Factors' mode to calculate the view factors.

The Instrument Throughput Calculation software was used to model the distribution of angles that get scattered into the detector when the system is set to a given geometry. The Effect of Instrument Signature on Microfacet Model software was used to take these distributions and model the error that would be induced on BRDF measurements of a glossy sample using a microfacet model.

The GonioAnalysis software is used to implement the measurement model for measurements of BRDF, BTDF, and integrated BRDF/BTDF made using the MSL goniospectrophotometer.
